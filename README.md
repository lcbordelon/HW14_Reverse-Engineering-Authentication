# Unit 14 Sequelize Homework: Reverse Engineering Code

Lindsay Bordelon

When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, this tutorial and file directory explanation will help you understand the code base.

The 'HW14Notes' file, in a Google Doc, is a tutorial explaining _every_ file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, that is also noted.

At the end of the tutorial, there are instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.
